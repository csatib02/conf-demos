# Telemetry as Code: Declarative Observability with OpenTelemetry

## Abstract

This talk introduces **telemetry as code**: bringing the same declarative principles that transformed infrastructure to your observability stack.

Using OpenTelemetry Collector Custom Resources and the Telemetry Controller, we'll demonstrate how to eliminate configuration drift, enable true multi-tenancy, and make observability as reliable and repeatable as your deployments.

What You'll Learn

Transform Your Telemetry Pipeline

- Replace brittle YAML with declarative Kubernetes CRDs that abstract complexity while maintaining flexibility
- Build tenant-aware routing that scales from single teams to enterprise-wide deployments

Master Production Patterns

- Leverage automated configuration validation and testing strategies that catch issues before production
- Navigate the hidden complexities of cross-namespace telemetry routing and security

Avoid Costly Mistakes

- Learn battle-tested approaches for managing collector configurations across diverse environments
